  The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The crowd far
  away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint
  murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There
  was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.

  It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the
  new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence. At any rate, as
  the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a
  movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the
  cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would
  advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a
  thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated
  horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.

  Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and
  heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling off
  the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from
  the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of
  whom was waving a white flag.
